## Rinkeby Testing

**Goerli faucet for sOHM:**
[Lives here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x800B3d87b77361F0D1d903246cA1F51b5acb43c9#writeContract), to retrieve test sOHM click `Connect to Web3` and use function #3: `dripSOHM`. After connecting to web3, click `Write` to execute and 10 sOHM will automatically be transferred to your connected wallet.

Note: The faucet is limited to one transfer per wallet every 6500 blocks (~1 day)

**Rinkeby faucet for WETH:**
[Wrap rinkeby eth on rinkeby uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)

**Rinkeby faucets for LUSD, FRAX & DAI can be taken from rinkeby etherscan:**

1. Go to `src/helpers/AllBonds.ts`
2. then copy the rinkeby `reserveAddress` for the applicable bond & navigate to that contract on rinkeby etherscan. 
3. On Rinkeby etherscan use the `mint` function. You can use the number helper for 10^18 & then add four more zeros for 10,000 units of whichever reserve you are minting.

### Architecture/Layout
The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container. 

The files/folder structure are a  **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

```
./src/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abi/          // Contract ABIs from etherscan.io
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/      // Redux actions

## üöÄ Deployment
Auto deployed on [Fleek.co](http://fleek.co/) fronted by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Since it is hosted via IPFS there is no running "server" component and we don't have server sided business logic. Users are served an `index.html` and javascript to run our applications. 

_**TODO**: TheGraph implementation/how/why we use it._


### Continuous deployment
Commits to the follow branches are automatically deployed to their respective URLs.
| Branch | URL |
| --- | --- |
| master | https://app. |
| deploy | https://staging. |

### NEW UX


### Powered by LiveTheLifeTV


We bring Zeus‚Äôs original vision to life by backing our treasury by gOHM. GVO is a membership community comprising of both digital and off-line benefits for members. It is important to note that we're not a currency or crypto project. We are a membership community that leverages a token as proof of membership. 

The GVO token enables us to properly coordinate. You mint an NFT on a very slight bonding curve purchases made in gOHM. The NFT gives you membership and yearly GVO emissions for access to services you can use in app. All money raised from NFT‚Äôs is held in the Treasury in gOHM - some of the gOHM is used to pair with GVO and the treasury management team use the other gOHM to mint safe loans at In this way the Treasury is ever growing from NFT membership sales - trading fees from gOHM-GVO swaps and the compounding rewards in gOHM
 
The goal is as much financial as it is about living the life. We want to express a feeling of community where people that love food, wine, art and tech come together. Resident artist from Genesis Dimitri Daniloff has bestowed us with his  artwork to support the movement.  Dimitri and our GVO art directooors will curate NFT‚Äôs from upcoming artists to join the initiative. The GVO brand needs to be bold, powerful, full of style and expressing freedom. This is just the genesis, those with our Values will always find a HOHM at GVO.

A like-minded, yet exclusive community is what GVO aims to be. We will adapt as we go along as with everything in the Metaverse, but we are a place for both tech-savvy and those who care only about the ‚Äúrebases‚Äù alike, to find a HOHM. We attract a diverse audience, who may associate with one of our many values or offerings. 

Since the token is not a security or financial instrument, additional benefits will feature in a friendly and communal dashboard provided by Olympus Pro. Similar to any NFT mint and display website with roadmap and cohmmunity, we add upon it the good OHMly vibes with their bonding and staking growth. To that effect, the user experience aims to be a beautiful blend of the artistic and the OHMly. 

### GVO / GITFLOW

* : git checkout develop
* : git pull: make sure you have all the latest changes
* : create new branch using git flow principles: 
    prefix with
    feat/ for new code or code changes
    fix/ for hotfixes
    example: feat/update_content_mint_page
* : make changes
* : commit with semantic commit message: 
     example: git commit -m "feat: updated content on mint page"
     more info on semantic commits
* : push
* : Open pull request into develop, use a good description, consider dividing it into # Scope (what is the goal of the PR), # Work done (What did you change to reach the goal), # Steps to test (how can a reviewer test your changes)
* : request review from ohmie
* : make any requested changes (go back to step 4)
* : if approved merge pull request
