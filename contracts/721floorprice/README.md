## Asset Backed ERC721

Inspired by [Dan Matuszewski's tweet](https://twitter.com/cmsholdings/status/1422693860036206592) asking the tough question, what really is an NFT floor?

This extension of the ERC721 standard requires NFTs to be backed by ERC20 assets at mint. The NFT can be burned at any time in order to recover the backing asset. This gives NFTs a "true floor".
